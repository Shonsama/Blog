Outsider Art
Outsider Art is a term used to describe art that is made by people who choose to live and work outside society. The artists who produce this kind of art-Outsider Artists- work in isolation from other artists and have little or no formal artistic training. Because they do not learn conventional artistic techniques from teachers or other artists, outsider artists must invent their own ways of doing things. As a result of the unconventional methods that outsider artists often use, their work can look strange and not at all like traditional art to the observer.
