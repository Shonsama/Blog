# 1.1 Bits and Their Storage
**Bits**: 0s and 1s
## Boolean Operation 
- AND: A AND B is True, A is True and B is True
- OR: A OR B is True, At least one of A and B is True
- XOR: A XOR B is True, either A or B but not both
## Gates and Flip-Flop
### Gates:
1. AND:
2. OR:
3. XOR:
4. NOT:
### Flip-flop

## Hexadecimal Notation 十六进制记数法
Stream：A long string of bits (0s and 1s)
<br/>
Hard to read and comprehend. So we need a new shorthand notation to simplify the representation of the string, which is ***Hexadecimal Notation***.
- Takes advantage of the fact that bit patterns within a machine tend to have lengths in multiples of four.
- Represent Table 
    - TODO:

# 1.2 Main Memory
A computer store a large number collection of ***circuits***
(such as flip-flops), each storing a **single bit** .This bit reservoir is known
as the machine’s ***main memory***.
## Memory Organization
